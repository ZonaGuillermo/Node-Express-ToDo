# Node-Express-ToDo

A TODO list made with NodeJS and Express using ES6 Modules.

In `/db` directory you will find a **SQL file** with the database and tables ready to import in your database manager.

Also you need to **rename** the `.envVOID` file to `.env` and fill the variables with your own values.

Good luck and enjoy :-)
